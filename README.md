### Prerequisites 📋

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 15.2.10.
This project was generated with Node version 18.18.0
This project was generated with NPM version 9.8.1

### Build with 🛠️

Visual Studio Code

### Instalation 🔧

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone

# Go into the repository
$ cd project

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

#Run backend
$ npm run backend

# Run the app
$ ng serve -o

```

### Scafolding 📁

For the organization at folder level I have followed an architecture as organized and scalable as possible within the standard construction, where all files are completely ordered in their respective place and named in the most understandable way possible.

### ESLint and Prettier 📄

This project has both ESLint and Prettier correctly installed and configured using the following commands:

```bash
# Install ESLint

npm install @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@latest --save-dev

# Configure ESLint

npm init @eslint/config

# Install Prettier

npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier

# Configuration

npm install eslint-config-prettier
```

And configuring both on the .prettierrc file, the package.json for the scripts and the local configurations in Visual Studio Code.

A hook is also configured in the .git folder of the project that prevents you from committing to the master branch to avoid possible problems and encourage you to work on other branches and use pull requests as the correct way to work. Here is an example of what would happen if you try to commit to the master branch:
